 Welcome to OpenTest, an open-source Test and Defect Management system which is designed to raise the bar of
technical skills and layered application understanding for QA Engineers by walking them through the conceptual
framework and pragmatic development experience of creating their own test and defect management application.

Presently, the database layer is being built, tested, and debugged.  Next, the application logic will be built
and uploaded here, and then a web front end.  The goal is to have sample packages built for OS-X, Linux, and
Windows.
