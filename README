Welcome to OpenTestCenter!

GOAL
The goal of OpenTestCenter is to enable QA Engineers to conceptualize and implement their own test and defect management systems and not have to rely on commercial products.  OpenTestCenter is currently in active development and seeking developers and test engineers who are interested in lending a hand to further this cause.  

RESPONSIBLE PARTY
OpenTestCenter is managed and at present designed and built by Eric C. Mumford in South Norwalk, CT and New York City (depending on the day.)  Eric may be reached at eric.mumford@gmail.com or on his blog http://www.websoftwareqa.com

STATE
Presently, the database layer is being built, tested, and documented.  Next, my guess is that an application layer will be built, and then a rudimentary and (later beautiful) web front end.  The goal is to have sample packages built for OS-X, Linux, and Windows x32/x64.

WHAT IS OPENTESTCENTER CONCEPTUALLY
OpenTestCenter is designed to be primarily a pragmatic guide to enable software QA engineers to create their own test and defect management tools.  At a theoretical-meta level, OpenTestCenter provides a written journal of how and why to create a database, application, and front end layer to manage tests and defects.  At a pragmatic level, OpenTestCenter provides not only a fully functional open source test and defect management system based on MySQL and Java, but also provides in its documentation the reasoning and logical thought structure behind each decision.  While this may be onerous and time consuming to read (and write), the author believes that creating this three-pronged attack on awful test management software (working software, documentation of why the software was architected the way it was, and instruction on how to build and test it yourself from scratch) will enable QA engineers to grow and flourish in their careers.
