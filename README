Welcome to OpenTestCenter!

GOAL
The goal of OpenTestCenter is to teach QA Engineers how to think about good testing better by providing two things.  One, a complete open source test and bug management system designed by testers based on the way testers really test - versus how testers are supposed to test; and two, a corresponding guide for QA engineers to read along in order to inspire and enable them to creating his or her own such system from their own testing principles.

RESPONSIBLE PARTY
Eric C. Mumford (eric.mumford@gmail.com) is the conceptual founder and primary contributor to OpenTestCenter.  Eric is looking for java superstars and DBAs to contribute anywhere from 30 minutes to 5 days of review, coding, and testing to OpenTestCenter.

STATE
At present the MySQL database layer is nearing alpha release.  The ER model is nearing maturity and Eric is authoring test data that can be used to run tests against the system.  This journal can be found in the /Scratch document as an open document format titled Part 2.  Note: The full text of Part 1 can be found in PDF form in the /Docs folder.




FURTHER COMMENTARY ON OPENTESTCENTER CONCEPTS
OpenTestCenter is designed to be primarily a pragmatic guide to enable software QA engineers to create their own test and defect management tools.  At a theoretical-meta level, OpenTestCenter provides a written journal of how and why to create a database, application, and front end layer to manage tests and defects.  At a pragmatic level, OpenTestCenter provides not only a fully functional open source test and defect management system based on MySQL and Java, but also provides in its documentation the reasoning and logical thought structure behind each decision.  While this may be onerous and time consuming to read (and write), the author believes that creating this three-pronged attack on awful test management software (working software, documentation of why the software was architected the way it was, and instruction on how to build and test it yourself from scratch) will enable QA engineers to grow and flourish in their careers.
