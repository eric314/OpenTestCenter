Welcome to OpenTest!

GOAL
The goal of OpenTest is to enable QA Engineers to conceptualize and implement their own test and defect management systems and not have to rely on commercial products.  OpenTest is currently in active development and seeking developers and test engineers who are interested in lending a hand to further this cause.  

RESPONSIBLE PARTY
OpenTest is managed and at present designed and built by Eric C. Mumford in New York City.  Eric may be reached at eric.mumford@gmail.com or on his blog http://www.websoftwareqa.com

STATE
Presently, the database layer is being built, tested, and debugged.  Next, the application logic will be built and uploaded here, and then a web front end.  The goal is to have sample packages built for OS-X, Linux, and Windows x32/x64.

WHAT IS OPENTEST CONCEPTUALLY
OpenTest will be a complete open-source Test and Defect Management system.  Eric's vision of OpenTest is to be accompanied by a free e-book which explains Eric's thinking about design options and his decision path.  Eric is taking this approach in order to allow the QA Engineer (or Developer) following along the schema and application design to understand and question the approach so that better, stronger systems may result.  The conceptual goal of OpenTest is not to provide "just another hackjob free test management package," but a pragmatic introspective guide through what good testing looks like and what tools serve such test management in order to raise the bar of technical skills and conceptual framework around good testing for QA Engineers.
