Welcome to OpenTestCenter!

GOAL
The goal of OpenTestCenter is to enable QA Engineers to conceptualize and implement their own test and defect management systems and not have to rely on commercial products.  OpenTestCenter is currently in active development and seeking developers and test engineers who are interested in lending a hand to further this cause.  

RESPONSIBLE PARTY
OpenTestCenter is managed and at present designed and built by Eric C. Mumford in South Norwalk, CT and New York City (depending on the day.)  Eric may be reached at eric.mumford@gmail.com or on his blog http://www.websoftwareqa.com

STATE
Presently, the database layer is being built, tested, and documented.  Next, the application logic will be built and uploaded here, and then a web front end.  The goal is to have sample packages built for OS-X, Linux, and Windows x32/x64.

WHAT IS OPENTESTCENTER CONCEPTUALLY
OpenTestCenter will be a complete open-source Test and Defect Management system.  Eric's vision of OpenTestCenter is to be accompanied by a free e-book which explains Eric's thinking about design options and his decision path.  Eric is taking this approach in order to allow the QA Engineer (or Developer) following along the schema and application design to understand and question the approach so that better, stronger systems may result.  The conceptual goal of OpenTestCenter is NOT to provide "just another hackjob free test management package,"* but, rather, a pragmatic and interesting guide to what good testing looks like and what tools serve such test management in order to raise the bar for technical skills and drill QAE's on the usefulness of having a conceptual framework around good testing (even if it differs from mine.)

*To be clear, OpenTestCenter in its current form IS absolutely a hack job.  Iteration by iteration, OpenTestCenter will become more beautiful.
