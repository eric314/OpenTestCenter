OpenTestCenter presentation layer

GOAL
Provide an open source front end (probably web/HTML5) which allows for seamless interfacing with tests and defects using the schema of the OpenTestCenter back end database.

RESPONSIBLE PARTY
There is no RP for the presentation layer so it is by default the product owner Eric Mumford, eric.mumford@gmail.com.  Actively seeking designers for help here and there with no payment other than good IPA, pizza, and my eternal thanks.

STATE
No work has started on the OpenTestCenter front end.
