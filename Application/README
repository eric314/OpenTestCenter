OpenTestCenter application layer

GOAL
Provide an open source application (probably in Java but perhaps ported to other languages also) which performs the necessary functions to allow a human to operate a test and defect management system using the schema of the OpenTestCenter back end database.

RESPONSIBLE PARTY
There is no RP for the application layer so it is by default the product owner Eric Mumford, eric.mumford@gmail.com.  Actively seeking Java experts for a few hours of help here and there with no payment other than good IPA, pizza, and my eternal thanks.

STATE
No work has started on the OpenTestCenter application layer.
