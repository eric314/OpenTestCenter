Journal recent to past:

- Some tweaks to Part 1, I think it looks good enough to review now.
- Alpha version of Part 2 (creating test data) completed, ready for review and critique.

10/08/2012 ECM
- Some significant updates to Part 1 as test data creation is spurring more ideas and a few adjustments to schema
- Significant schema tweaks, mostly to fields that do not need to be unique or non-nullable, and field length bumps
- Normalized my approach to mapping tests and defects to test suites, test sets, and build contents

9/27/2012 ECM
- The PDF database doc is a complete alpha version of the conceptual framework behind the data layer.
- The current PDF doc by and large matches the ER diagram currently uploaded.
- The SQL file that creates the MySQL database may not match the ER diagram due to small iterative changes to the diagram that are not forward engineered often and changed here due to limited time constraints and limited value.
- Part 2 of the documentation is in authorship at present, titled Part 2 - Planning, Designing, and Executing Test Data on the OpenTestCenter Database.  It will contain a complete record of the conceptual thought framework behind back end testing, the creation of test data using an implementation of the database realized from Part 1.
