- The PDF database doc is a complete alpha version of the conceptual framework behind the data layer.
- The current PDF doc by and large matches the ER diagram currently uploaded.
- The SQL file that creates the MySQL database may not match the ER diagram due to small iterative changes to the diagram that are not forward engineered often and changed here due to limited time constraints and limited value.
- Part 2 of the documentation is in authorship at present, titled Part 2 - Planning, Designing, and Executing Test Data on the OpenTestCenter Database.  It will contain a complete record of the conceptual thought framework behind back end testing, the creation of test data using an implementation of the database realized from Part 1.

Please send bug reports directly to me at eric.mumford@gmail.com

Thank you for supporting OpenTestCenter.
