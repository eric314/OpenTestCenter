OpenTestCenter Database system

GOAL
Provide an open source database constructed from the perspective of how real testers actually test.

RESPONSIBLE PARTY
OpenTestCenter data layer is managed at at present designed and built by Eric C. Mumford.  Eric may be reached at eric.mumford@gmail.com.  Eric is actively seeking critique and updates to the schema based on the principles contained in the accompanying text, which is not yet uploaded.  So you'll have to guess.

STATE
The contained files will successfully forward engineer a MySQL database on the user's machine.

CONTENTS
OpenTest DB Schema.mwb      The MySQL workbench model ER diagram
OpenTest_MySQL_Forward_Engineered_SQL_File.sql     The SQL file to run to build the OpenTest alpha database.  Contains 30 tables (I'd like to do it in less), foreign keys connecting the tables, and basic indexes generated by MySQL Workbench.

Note: The accompanying text guiding the reader along Eric's thought process is in editing and the alpha version will be uploaded soon.
