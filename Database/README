OpenTestCenter:
-> Database layer

GOAL
Provide an open source database providing for test and defect management constructed from the perspective of how real testers actually test.

RESPONSIBLE PARTY
OpenTestCenter data layer is managed at at present designed and built by Eric C. Mumford.  Eric may be reached at eric.mumford@gmail.com.  Eric is actively seeking critique and updates to the schema based on the principles contained in the accompanying text, which is not yet uploaded.  So you'll have to guess.

STATE
The contained files will successfully forward engineer a MySQL database on the user's machine.

CONTENTS
OpenTest DB Schema.mwb      The MySQL workbench model ER diagram
OpenTest_MySQL_Forward_Engineered_SQL_File.sql     The SQL file to run to build the OpenTest alpha database in MySQL.  Contains ~30 tables (I'd like to do it in less), foreign keys connecting the tables, and basic indexes generated by MySQL Workbench.

Note, the accompanying text explaining the thought process behind why this database is structured the way it is can be found in the Docs folder as Part 1 of the documentation of OpenTestCenter.
