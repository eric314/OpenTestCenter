OpenTest Database system

GOAL
Provide an open source database constructed from the perspective of how real testers actually test.

RESPONSIBLE PARTY
OpenTest data layer is managed at at present designed and built by Eric C. Mumford.  Eric may be reached at eric.mumford@gmail.com.  Eric is actively seeking critique and updates to the schema based on the principles contained in the accompanying text, which is not yet uploaded.  So you'll have to guess.

STATE
The database folder of OpenTest contains the SQL file needed to build a MySQL database for OpenTest's back end.  The accompanying text guiding the reader along Eric's thought process is in editing and the alpha version will be uploaded soon.  The ER diagram is available in this directory which is readable by MySQL Workbench.
